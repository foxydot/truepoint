Creates an interactive dictionary of terms and definitions with jQuery and shortcodes.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a complete Dictionary on your site. It defines a new post type, Definitions, and its own taxonomy, Families (of Terms and Definitions).

This plugin is very useful if you need to explain to your visitors technical words or something else, just moving their mouse over the word.

It is fully configurable along its options page: color, size, movement, effects, autodetection...

For adding a definition to your post, first, you must create the definition in the Definitions section. After that, go to your post, and write "[def]Term[/def]", where Term is the title of your definition (or the slug, or the ID, if you have configured the plugin that way).

It allows .mo and .po translation files. The plugin supports:

* English, Spanish.
* Italian, Brazilian Portuguese and Portuguese (Thanks to Javier Valenzuela!).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Where are the Definitions located? =

All the definitions that you creates with the Definitions section are located in your Database, in the wp_posts table, with the post_type = 'definiciones'.

= Does It works with pages? =

Yes, it do. It works with post, pages, and every type that use "the_content" to generate its content. This plugin acts on the_content() function.

= jQuery? Do I have to write code? =

No, absolutely. With the options form, the jQuery settings will be auto written.

= The jQuery effect does not appear! Why? =

First, check the options form. Have you selected the jQuery Effects mode? I assume yes. If this is happening, probably other plugin uses JavaScript or jQuery too and is not working. When JavaScript launches an error, the rest of JS code does not work. Try deactivate your other plugins.

= The jQuery effect STILL does not appear!! =

Ok, ok, don't panic. Use the support page and I will try to help you.

= Can I configure the effect of the plugin for every post? =

If you want to have different effects in every single post, nope, you can not. If you want different colors, size, etc, you can play with CSS.

= Has the shortcodes any additional option? =

Yes, three: [def url='http://www.yoursite.com/]Term[/def] will convert the Term also in a link; [def id='id1']Term[/def] will add to the span where the Term is located the id "id1"; and [def class='class1'] will add to the span the class 'class1'.

= Is the auto detection case sensitive? =

No, if you write 'hello' and have a definition called 'Hello', it will works.

= Do the auto detection works in slug or id modes? =

No, the auto detection works always in Title mode, no matter what did you selected in the options form. The auto detection was created to be compatible with old entries without edit them.

= I want to set auto detection for old posts, but I don't want it in new posts =

Set in the options page "Auto Detect" -> "Yes, when there is no other definitions". Then, in your new posts, set at least one definition. The autodetection will not work in that post.

== Screenshots ==

1. New Custom Type and Taxonomy for Definitions.
