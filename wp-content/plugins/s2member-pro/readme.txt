Add-on module for the free version of s2Member. s2Member Pro adds PayPal® Pro integration, advanced import/export tools, and much more.

== Installation ==

= s2Member Pro is very easy to install ( instructions ) =
1. First, you need to have the latest version of the [s2Member Framework](http://www.primothemes.com/post/product/s2member-membership-plugin-with-paypal/) already installed.
2. Then, upload the `/s2member-pro` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. That's it! s2Member Pro will be loaded into the free version of s2Member automatically.

= It's really that simple? =
Yep. No need to activate the s2Member Pro Module. The free version of s2Member will automatically load the Pro Module.

*After installing the Pro Module, you'll want to re-explore all of the options for s2Member. s2Member Pro adds new features. In particular, you'll want to go back over all of your `s2Member -> PayPal® Options`. You can also enable/disable other Payment Gateways from the `s2Member -> Other Gateways` panel in your Dashboard.*
 
= Upgrading to the latest version? =
Please visit [this page](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=247) for [easy upgrade instructions](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=247).

s2Member Pro is an add-on module for the [free version](http://www.primothemes.com/post/product/s2member-membership-plugin-with-paypal/) of s2Member. s2Member Pro adds support for unlimited Membership Levels, [PayPal® Pro integration](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=304) ( highly recommended ), PayPal® Pro Form Generators and additional support for Recurring Billing with PayPal®. s2Member also supports Authorize.Net® integration via AIM/ARB and Pro Form Generators, ccBill® ( for adult-oriented sites ), Google® Checkout integration, ClickBank® integration, AliPay® integration, User Import/Export tools, support for Coupon Codes, a Login Widget ( plus Profile Summary ), Lock Icons in the Dashboard, and more. New features will be added in future versions of s2Member Pro. A purchase of s2Member Pro includes free upgrades via s2Member.com ( i.e. new features, bug fixes, updates, improvements ); along with full access to our [video tutorial library](http://www.s2member.com/videos/).

s2Member supports Free Subscribers (at Level #0), and four primary Membership Levels [1-4] (unlimited with s2Member Pro). You can label your Membership Levels anything you like. The defaults are Free, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. s2Member also supports an unlimited number of Custom Capability Packages. Custom Capabilities are an easy way to extend s2Member in creative ways. Custom Capabilities allow you to create an unlimited number of Membership Packages, all with different Capabilities and prices. Instead of using multiple Levels, you could create an unlimited number of Custom Capability Packages; each with different permissions, prices, etc. Custom Capabilities can also be integrated with WordPress® themes in very creative ways, through the application of Simple and/or Advanced Conditionals made available by s2Member.

s2Member allows you to protect Pages, Posts, Tags, Categories, URIs, URI word fragments, URI Replacement Codes for BuddyPress, Specific Post/Page "Buy Now" Access, and even portions of content within Posts/Pages/themes/plugins. Everything is configurable through the s2Member Options Panel. This makes s2Member VERY easy to integrate into any WordPress®-powered site. With s2Member, you can also protect downloadable files, using special restrictions on how many downloads can occur within a certain amount of time; all based on Membership Level.

Each Membership Level can have different restrictions, and you could even integrate Conditionals within your content based on Member Level. Advanced code samples are provided under s2Member -> API Scripting -> Advanced Conditionals. s2Member has been fully integrated with the Roles & Capabilities that are already built into WordPress®. No new tables :-) It is designed to be completely seamless, without code bloat. We've carefully structured the entire framework, in order to maximize s2Member's ability to operate with other plugins installed. For instance, s2Member is compatible with BuddyPress; and it can even be used to protect forums powered by bbPress.

New! - Now you can sell Specific Post/Page Access ( membership not required ), using "Buy Now" buttons. You can even package multiple Posts/Pages together into one "Buy Now" transaction. Specific Post/Page Access, is like selling a product. Only, instead of shipping anything to the Customer, you just give them access to a specific Post/Page on your site; one that you created in WordPress®. A Specific Post/Page that is protected by s2Member, might contain a download link for your eBook, access to file & music downloads, access to support services, and the list goes on and on. The possibilities with this are endless; as long as your digital product can be delivered through access to a WordPress® Post/Page. For instance, you might sell an existing Member an additional item ( without affecting their current Membership plan ).

= Can I use PayPal® Pro, Authorize.Net®, ccBill®, AliPay®, ClickBank®, Google® Checkout? =
Yes. [s2Member Pro](http://www.s2member.com/) is an add-on module for the [free version](http://www.primothemes.com/post/product/s2member-membership-plugin-with-paypal/) of s2Member. s2Member Pro adds [PayPal® Pro integration](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=304) ( highly recommended ), PayPal® Pro Form Generators and additional support for Recurring Billing. s2Member also supports Authorize.Net® integration via AIM/ARB and Pro Form Generators, ccBill® ( for adult-oriented sites ), Google® Checkout integration, ClickBank® integration, AliPay® integration, User Import/Export tools, support for Coupon Codes, a Login Widget ( plus Profile Summary ), Lock Icons in the Dashboard, and more.

A purchase of s2Member Pro includes free lifetime upgrades via s2Member.com ( i.e. new features, bug fixes, updates, improvements ); along with full access to our [video tutorial library](http://www.s2member.com/videos/).

= What is the #1 Benefit To Using s2Member's Pro Form integrations? =
Hands down, increased conversion rates! Not all Customers prefer to use PayPal®. With s2Member Pro you're keeping Customers on your site throughout the entire checkout process. You can control the surrounding elements on the page, the flow of events, and do a better job at building confidence in your products/services. We've seen conversions rates increase by as much as double! With PayPal® Pro and/or Authorize.Net® integrations, you can support on-site credit card processing for Visa®, MasterCard®, American Express®, and Discover®. If you decide to go with PayPal® Pro, you can also accept Maestro®, Solo®, and PayPal® Express Checkout - for Customers that prefer to pay with PayPal®. For more information, we suggest this [video demo](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=304).

PayPal "Subscriptions" ( i.e. PayPal's Standard Integration ), requires Customers to create a PayPal® account at checkout. With s2Member Pro this is no longer a requirement. With [PayPal® Pro integration](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=304), you can charge your Customers on a recurring basis, if you wish; and without them even going through PayPal®. They can just use a credit/debit card on your site. The same is true with Authorize.Net® integration.

= What type of PayPal® account do I need? =
The s2Member Pro Module makes it possible for s2Member to use PayPal® Pro Forms ( instead of standard PayPal® Buttons ). PayPal® Pro Forms integrate seamlessly with WordPress® Shortcodes. This allows you to keep Customers on your site at all times, and it consolidates the Checkout / Registration steps into a single form that you can dress up just the way you like. If you would like to take advantage of PayPal® Pro integration, you will need a [PayPal® Business Account, w/Pro Service](http://www.s2member.com/paypal). PayPal® Pro accounts require a formal application.

Once you have your PayPal® Pro account, you'll need access to your [PayPal® API Credentials](http://www.s2member.com/paypal-profile-api-access). Log into your PayPal® account, and navigate to `Profile -> API Access (or Request API Credentials)`. You'll choose `( Request API Signature )`. Once you've got your API Credentials, come back and paste them into the fields provided by s2Member, under: `PayPal® Options -> Account Details`.

If you plan to use any of the ( `Subscription` ) options in the s2Member Form Generator for PayPal® Pro, you will ALSO need [Recurring Billing](http://www.s2member.com/paypal-pro-recurring-payments-faqs) enabled for your PayPal® Pro account. PayPal's Recurring Billing service for Pro accounts is **required** for all types of ( `Subscriptions` ), whether you intend for them to be recurring or not. However, it is NOT required for ( `Buy Now` ) functionality. The drop-down menus in the s2Member Form Generator, have been marked ( `Subscription` ) and ( `Buy Now` ) just for this reason. See: `s2Member -> PayPal® Pro Forms`. This way you can see which options will require the use of PayPal's Recurring Billing service. PayPal® will charge you a small monthly fee for their Recurring Billing service; which is an add-on for PayPal® Pro accounts.

= Do I have to use PayPal® Pro? =
No. s2Member is very flexible. Even with the Pro Module installed, you don't **have** to use PayPal® Pro integration. Just don't generate any PayPal® Pro Forms. Instead, you could use Standard PayPal® Buttons, AliPay®, ClickBank®, ccBill®, Authorize.Net®, or Google® Checkout if you prefer ( you could even use them all together at the same time ). Alternatively, s2Member Pro can be integrated without a PayPal® Pro account, whereby the enhanced Form Shortcodes that it provides can be integrated ONLY with PayPal® Express Checkout. In other words, if you get declined for PayPal® Pro service, you can still use s2Member Pro Forms by following these instructions:

**Step #1.** Ask PayPal® to activate Express Checkout for you. ( free )

Express Checkout will give you API Credentials, and you'll enter these into: `s2Member -> PayPal Options`.

**Step #2.** In the Shortcodes provided by s2Member Pro... **change this:** `accept_via_paypal="paypal"` **to this instead:** `accept_via_paypal="paypal,visa,mastercard,amex,discover,maestro,solo"`.

**PayPal® Express Checkout Limitations** If you decide NOT to acquire a PayPal® Pro account, and instead integrate ONLY with PayPal® Express Checkout, please understand the following limitation. PayPal® Express Checkout is intended to facilitate payments for PayPal® account owners and/or Customers willing to signup for PayPal® during checkout. It is NOT possible for a Customer to go through PayPal® Express Checkout without having and/or acquiring a PayPal® account, regardless of the transaction type *( i.e. Buy Now functionality is no exception to this rule )*. This is because PayPal® Express Checkout is really intended for Customers that *prefer* to pay with PayPal®. So although it's possible to integrate Pro Forms without a PayPal® Pro account, we recommend that you acquire a PayPal® Pro account, so that you can accept credit cards on-site, and then offer PayPal® Express Checkout to Customers that *prefer* to pay with PayPal®. That's the way s2Member Pro Forms are designed to work, in an ideal fashion.

= Can I use s2Member's Pro Forms with AliPay®, ccBill®, Google® Checkout or ClickBank? =
No. s2Member's "Pro Forms" should be used ONLY with Authorize.Net®, PayPal® Pro integration, or alternatively, with PayPal® Express Checkout using the Express Checkout technique described above ( i.e. using `accept_via_paypal=""` ). Other Payment Gateway integrations can be used in conjunction with your Pro Forms, but they don't require you to use Pro Forms to integrate them. For example: ClickBank®, AliPay®, ccBill®, PayPal® Standard, and Google® Checkout - can all be integrated easily without needing an SSL certificate, and without using s2Member's Pro Form system.

= Can I change the width of PayPal® Pro Forms easily? =
Yes, just take your Shortcode, and wrap it inside a div tag. Pro Forms will automatically expand to 100% width of their parent element. So wrapping them inside a div tag with a specific width is the easiest way.

	<div style="width:750px;">
		[s2Member-Pro-PayPal-Form ... /]
	</div>

or with Pro Forms for Authorize.Net®

	<div style="width:750px;">
		[s2Member-Pro-AuthNet-Form ... /]
	</div>

= What is the minimum width needed for s2Member's Pro Forms? =
Around 450 pixels wide. Technically you could go smaller, but things start to get cramped around 400px or so. Just about any WordPress® theme will do fine; even with a Sidebar.

= Can I upgrade my existing PayPal® account to Pro status? =
Yes, just log into your existing PayPal® Business account, and follow the links to "Upgrade". Upgrading your account to PayPal® Pro status requires a formal application, along with a small monthly fee.

= Do I need an SSL certificate to use PayPal® Pro or Authorize.Net®? =
If you're using s2Member's Pro Forms, then yes. In order to comply with PayPal®, Authorize.Net® and PCI Compliance policies, as set forth by major credit card companies; you will need to host all of your Pro Forms on an SSL enabled site. Please check with your hosting provider to ask about obtaining an SSL certificate for your domain. Please note... when you create Pro Forms using the Form Generators provided by s2Member; you'll be supplied with WordPress® Shortcodes, which you'll insert into Posts/Pages of your choosing. These special Posts/Pages will need to be displayed in SSL mode, using links that start with ( `https://` ). In other words, when you link to these Posts/Pages, you'll need to make sure your links start with `https://`.

*You can skip the SSL certificate during Development/Sandbox testing. SSL is not required until you officially go live. Once you're live, you can add the Custom Field `s2member_force_ssl -> yes` to any Post/Page. s2Member will buffer output on those special Posts/Pages, converting everything over to `https://` for you automatically, and forcing those specific Posts/Pages to be viewed over a secure SSL connection; so long as your server supports the https protocol. This will help you eliminate the dreaded Secure/Insecure errors in Internet Explorer®. If your server runs SSL over a special port number, or your server requires the port number to actually be in the URL ( i.e. HOST:port ), you can set `s2member_force_ssl -> 443`; or to whatever port you need.*

= Is WordPress® compatible with SSL enabled? =
Yes, WordPress® is indeed compatible with SSL enabled ( `https://` ). However, not all themes/plugins are designed to behave properly with SSL enabled. For instance, some WordPress® themes/plugins embed links to images, scripts, and/or style sheets; all starting with `http://`, instead of `https://`, ( or just `//:` - which is cross-protocol compatible ). For this reason, you should be very careful when choosing a WordPress® theme/plugin to use with s2Member Pro. Otherwise, your visitors could see the famous "Secure/Insecure" warnings in Internet Explorer® browsers. A good web developer can fix this minor issue with ease, but novice site owners are advised to get help from a professional.

*Tip: All themes available at [PriMoThemes.com](http://www.primothemes.com/) include full support for SSL enabled Posts/Pages. Also, with s2Member installed, you can add the Custom Field `s2member_force_ssl -> yes` to any Post/Page. s2Member will buffer output on those special Posts/Pages, converting everything over to `https://` for you automatically, and forcing those specific Posts/Pages to be viewed over a secure SSL connection; so long as your server supports the https protocol.

= Can I test PayPal® Pro Forms using a PayPal® Sandbox account? =
Yes. If you'd like to run test transactions against an s2Member / PayPal® Pro configuration, get yourself a [PayPal® Developer Account](http://www.s2member.com/paypal-developers). Then, create a new PayPal® Pro Seller account inside the Sandbox; with PayPal® Pro enabled - which requires a special, yet "fake" application. Whenever you fill out the fake Pro-Application, be sure to start your Social Security # with `111`, and then use whatever random numbers you prefer.

You'll need to configure s2Member with your Sandbox API Credentials, and supply a Sandbox email address that is tied to a PayPal® Pro Sandbox account. Once you have all of that, you can add a fake credit card to any Personal Sandbox account ( that is, a Buyer account ). Log out of your WordPress® Dashboard before testing. You can use your fake card number &amp; expiration date for running test transactions as a would-be Customer.

= Can I test Authorize.Net® Pro Forms using a Developer Test Account? =
Yes. If you'd like to run test transactions against an s2Member / Authorize.Net® configuration, get yourself a [Developer Test Account](http://www.s2member.com/authorize.net-test-accounts). You'll need to configure s2Member with your Developer API Login ID, Transaction Key, and Secret MD5 Hash. Also, don't forget to place your installation of s2Member into Authorize.Net® Development/Sandbox Mode. In your Dashboard, see: `s2Member -> Authorize.Net® Options -> Account Details`.

= Problems between s2Member ( the free version ), and s2Member Pro? =
Nope. If it works in the free version, it just works better in the Pro version! The s2Member Pro Module requires the s2Member Framework ( the free version ) to be installed first. s2Member Pro adds full support for PayPal® Pro integration, Authorize.Net®, ccBill®, AliPay®, ClickBank®, and Google® Checkout. These integrations have been specifically designed for compatibility with all s2Member Framework features. In other words, everything that works in the free version, will ALSO work with the Pro Module. Including, but not limited to: Membership Levels, Custom Capabilities, Access Restrictions, List Server integrations, API Notifications, Tracking Codes, Shortcode attributes, API Conditionals, API Constants, General Options, Content Dripping, etc.

*There is one minor issue worth mentioning. With PayPal® Pro integration, you absolutely MUST configure a default IPN URL inside your PayPal® account. Please see: `s2Member -> PayPal® Options -> IPN Integration` for full details - along with work-arounds for any cross-domain issues you might run into. The free version of s2Member ( with PayPal® Standard integration ) does NOT require this, but with PayPal® Pro - you MUST have an IPN URL configured inside your PayPal® Pro account. s2Member cannot override the default IPN URL on a per-transaction basis with the Pro API.*

*If you're using a single PayPal® Pro account for multiple cross-domain installations, and you need to receive IPN notifications for each of your domains; you'll want to create a central IPN processing script that scans variables in each IPN response, forking itself out to each of your individual domains. In rare cases when this is necessary, you'll find two variables in all IPN responses for s2Member. The originating domain name ( i.e. `www.example.com` ) will always be included somewhere within, either: `custom` and/or `rp_invoice_id`; depending on the type of transaction. These variables can be used to test incoming IPNs, and fork to the proper installation.*
 
= Will I need to hire a web developer to install s2Member Pro for me? =
It depends. s2Member Pro is fairly straight forward, and documentation is built right into the software. If you can get a PayPal® Pro Account, &amp; then find your API Credentials after logging into PayPal® Pro ... you can probably do it yourself. That being said, if you have plans to do something VERY creative, or need customizations that are not possible without having some knowledge of WordPress® / PHP / HTML.. then yes, you will want to find yourself a freelancer.

= s2Member's Pro Forms are acting funny on my site, why? =
Check your WordPress® theme. Make sure it is NOT introducing any JavaScript errors on the Post/Page. s2Member's Pro Forms require some mild interaction with JavaScript routines; which are self-installed by the s2Member Pro Module. However, if your theme ( or other plugins ) introduce JavaScript errors/warnings, those can ( and will ) prevent s2Member's routines from succeeding.

= Do I need the s2Clean Theme? =
No. Both s2Member ( the [free version](http://www.primothemes.com/post/product/s2member-membership-plugin-with-paypal/) ), as well as the [s2Member Pro Module](http://www.s2member.com/prices/) will work in just about ANY WordPress® theme. That being said, if you're starting a brand new site, we DO suggest the [s2Clean Theme](http://www.primothemes.com/post/product/s2clean-theme-for-wordpress/), because it has already been setup specifically for s2Member, which will cut down on your development time. For example, the s2Clean Theme comes with a login box built into the site, and it also comes with pre-built Page Templates for s2Member's Login Welcome Page. You could create both of these inside WordPress® using any theme, even without Templates; but the s2Clean Theme makes it all much easier to work with.

= Is there a way to call upon the Pro Login Widget directly? =
Yes, you can use this PHP tag if you'd like. `<?php echo s2member_pro_login_widget(); ?>`. For further details, please check your WordPress® Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Pro Login Widget via PHP`. There are several options that can be configured dynamically through the PHP tag. It's not required, but you can get pretty creative if you check out the full documentation.

= If I have the Pro Module installed, can I still use PayPal® Buttons? =
It is up to you, but yes. You can even use both Pro and Standard integration together at the same time. If you have some products that you prefer to sell exclusively through PayPal®, you can use PayPal® Buttons ( Standard Integration ), while still using PayPal® Pro Forms ( Pro Integration ) in other areas. The same is true for Authorize.Net®, ccBill®, AliPay®, ClickBank®, and Google® Checkout integrations. All of s2Member's Payment Gateway integrations can operate together in harmony if you like. In your Dashboard, you can enable/disable the ones you intend to use.

= Is the free version of s2Member still being supported? =
Yes, without a doubt. The free version of s2Member ( aka: the s2Member Framework ), is the foundation on which the s2Member Pro Module, and future development will occur.

= Does s2Member Pro support PayPal's Advanced Fraud Management Filters? =
No, not at this time. The basic Fraud Management Filters that come free with all PayPal® Pro accounts IS supported, but PayPal's Advanced Fraud Management Filters are not supported at this time. Advanced Fraud Management is usually requested by companies that are "shipping" expensive physical products, where the overall risk is much higher. That being said, support for Advanced Fraud Management will come in a future update for s2Member Pro. It's just not a high priority at the moment.

= Does s2Member Pro support Authorize.Net's Fraud Detection Suite? =
Yes. s2Member's integration with Authorize.Net® allows you to configure your Authorize.Net® account in just about any way you like. If you'd like to configure your Fraud Detection Suite ( i.e. AVS rules, Velocity, etc ); please feel free to do so. Just be sure to follow the basic instructions that s2Member provides you with first. You will find the basic setup instructions in your WP Dashboard under: `s2Member -> Authorize.Net® Options -> Account Details`. There are certain aspects of your Authorize.Net® account that MUST be configured exactly as s2Member instructs. For example, you must configure a Silent Post URL ( provided by s2Member ), and your Transaction Version must be set to `3.1`.

= Does the s2Member Pro Module store any financial information in my WordPress® database tables? =
No, all financial details; including, but not limited to; credit card numbers, expiration dates, and billing addresses; are ALL stored securely, inside your PayPal®, Authorize.Net®, ccBill®, AliPay®, ClickBank®, and/or Google® Checkout accounts; and NOT within WordPress®. s2Member only stores a Paid Subscr. ID ( aka: Recurring Profile ID, etc. ) inside existing WordPress® database tables, as an easy way to reference information obtained through API calls to your Payment Gateway(s). s2Member only uses approved API connection routines that are provided by your Payment Gateway(s).

= Am I required to keep the PayPal® logo visible on my PayPal® Pro Forms? =
If you're using PayPal® Pro integration, then yes. Please read PayPal's Terms, under section #8. [Required Use Of Express Checkout](http://www.s2member.com/paypal-pro-tos).

= Where can I find a list of all PayPal® Pro fees? =
Please read the [PayPal® Website Payments Pro and Virtual Terminal Agreement](http://www.s2member.com/paypal-pro-tos).

= Can I create new Membership accounts manually with s2Member? =
Yes. In addition, with PayPal® Pro ( and with Authorize.Net® ) you're supplied with a Virtual Terminal; so you could also accept transactions by mail, or by phone. After you've accepted a transaction ( or not, does not matter ), just log into your WordPress® Dashboard, and go to `WordPress® -> Users -> Add New`. Fill in basic details, and send the Customer their Username/Password. After creating the User account manually, you'll want to set the Customer's **Paid® Subscr. ID** manually, this way s2Member can take over with programmatic management going forward into the future. You can even set a manual EOT Time if you like ( optional ). In your Dashboard, navigate to `WordPress® -> Users`, and click "Edit" next to the Customer you wish to edit. The value of **Paid® Subscr. ID**, can be a PayPal® Standard "Subscription ID", or a PayPal® Pro "Recurring Profile ID", or a PayPal® "Transaction ID"; depending on the type of sale. Your PayPal® Virtual Terminal will supply this information. If you're using Google® Checkout, use the TID/SID value in the sale Description; it always starts with `s2-` ). ClickBank® provides a Receipt #, ccBill® provides a Subscription ID, Authorize.Net® provides a Subscription ID, and AliPay® provides a Transaction ID that you can use. The general rule is... IF there's a Subscription ID, use that! If there's NOT, use the Transaction ID.

= Does s2Member make any HTTP connections back to PriMoThemes.com or WebSharks, Inc? =
No. The only remote connections made by s2Member are those required to use the software. For instance: PayPal® ( if configured ), ClickBank® ( if configured ), AliPay® ( if configured ), Google® Checkout ( if configured ), Authorize.Net® ( if configured ), ccBill® ( if configured ), MailChimp® ( if configured ), AWeber® ( if configured ), etc.

= How can I allow Free Registration? =
s2Member Pro comes with Pro Form Generators for PayPal® Pro and Authorize.Net® integrations. You can generate a Pro Form for Free Registration. This allows you to bypass the default registration system used by the free version of s2Member. This particular Pro Form ( e.g. a Free Registration Form ) does NOT require you to have a PayPal® or Authorize.Net® account. You can use it anywhere you like. Another nice thing about this Free Registration Form, is that you can insert it with a Shortcode into any Post/Page you like, and you can do this without enabling Open Registration on a site wide basis. For site owners that want to open the door for Free Registration based on certain criteria, you could integrate s2Member's Free Registration Form into a Post/Page, and then wrap your Shortcode with PHP Conditional tags. With this advanced technique, you could authenticate visitors ( i.e. free registrants ) in very custom ways.

= s2Member does this, but I want it to do that. Is that possible? =
We get this type of question a lot. The answer is most definitely **yes**. The entire s2Member Framework is extremely versatile. For instance, s2Member Pro is built on top of the free s2Member Framework; on top of the worlds' most powerful publishing platform ( WordPress® ). That being said, you WILL need be familiar with PHP, and WordPress® Hooks/Filters in order to integrate your own customizations. We suggest hiring a freelancer familiar with WordPress®.

= Is it possible to modify the PayPal® and/or Authorize.Net® Pro Form templates? =
Usually not necessary. But yes, if you really need to. Please check your `/s2member-pro/includes/templates/forms/` directory. You can take the default templates, and place some ( or all of them ) into your own WordPress® theme directory. s2Member Pro will automatically find your custom templates there. By placing custom templates into your theme directory, you can be sure they won't get overwritten in a future upgrade. Either that, or you can just use the default templates like they are, and customize them with your own CSS rules inside the Stylesheet for your WordPress® theme ( i.e. style.css ). If you're using a PriMo Theme ( for instance, the s2Clean Theme ), check your Theme Options Panel, under: `Custom CSS / Style Sheet`.

= How can I prevent s2Member Pro from loading it's default CSS? =
You can create this directory and file:
/wp-content/mu-plugins/s2-hacks.php
	
	<?php
	add_action ("ws_plugin__s2member_after_loaded", "remove_s2_pro_css");
	function remove_s2_pro_css ()
		{
			remove_action ("ws_plugin__s2member_during_css", "c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_css_js::css");
		}
	?>

Or, you could remove only specific action Hooks; based on Payment Gateway.

	<?php
	add_action ("ws_plugin__s2member_after_loaded", "remove_s2_pro_css");
	function remove_s2_pro_css ()
		{
			remove_action ("ws_plugin__s2member_during_css", "c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_alipay_css_js::alipay_css");
			remove_action ("ws_plugin__s2member_during_css", "c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_css_js::authnet_css");
			remove_action ("ws_plugin__s2member_during_css", "c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_ccbill_css_js::ccbill_css");
			remove_action ("ws_plugin__s2member_during_css", "c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_clickbank_css_js::clickbank_css");
			remove_action ("ws_plugin__s2member_during_css", "c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_google_css_js::google_css");
			remove_action ("ws_plugin__s2member_during_css", "c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_paypal_css_js::paypal_css");
		}
	?>

= Does s2Member Pro support international transactions/currencies? =
Yes. You can learn all about [PayPal® Pro here](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=304). In fact, almost all of the Payment Gateways integrated with s2Member Pro will support international transactions and international currencies. PayPal® supports most countries, as does Authorize.Net®, ccBill®, Google® Checkout, and ClickBank® does too. AliPay® is intended to reach Customers mainly in China.

= I generated a PayPal® Pro Form for Billing Updates, why is PayPal® not an option? =
Customers that paid you originally with their PayPal® account, will be given a "special" message when they arrive at a Billing Update Form. s2Member will explain - they need to log into their PayPal® account in order to update their Billing Information. It is not possible ( even with Pro integration ) to access a secure PayPal® account belonging to a Customer. For this reason, Customers that originally paid through PayPal®, must log into their actual PayPal® account to update their Billing Information. This is why there is no PayPal® option on the Billing Update Form; because on-site Billing Updates work only for Customers that paid you with a Credit/Debit card; such as Visa®, MasterCard®, Amex®, Discover®, Maestro®, and/or Solo®.

= What if I don't want to accept Maestro/Solo? =
If you want to be specific about which Billing Methods you accept, you can pass a special attribute into your Shortcode ( `accept=""` ). List all of the Billing Methods you want to accept ( in comma-delimited format ). Here is an example: `accept="paypal,visa,mastercard,amex,discover"`. If you're using PayPal® Pro, you must always accept PayPal®. s2Member Pro will NOT allow you to exclude PayPal® from the list. s2Member's integration with Authorize.Net® Pro Forms are NOT subjected to this restriction though.

= Is there a way to force a custom redirect after a successful purchase? =
Yes. You can add the following attribute to the Shortcode for your Form. Like this: `success="http://www.example.com/thank-you.php"`. s2Member will automatically redirect Customers to the URL you specify. s2Member can also add query string parameters, supplying all sorts of information about the transaction. Please see `s2Member -> PayPal® Pro Forms -> Custom Return URLs on Success`. This also works with Pro Forms for Authorize.Net®.

= Can s2Member implement a Captcha Code on my Login/Registration Forms? =
Yes and no. We've left this feature out of the plugin intentionally, because many site owners prefer to use Captcha plugins that encompass all aspects of their site ( including comment forms ). We recommend this one: [SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/). That being said, s2Member's Pro Forms for PayPal® Pro and Authorize.Net® ( including Free Registration Forms ) CAN be configured to use Google's reCAPTCHA service ( which is free ). Just add this Attribute to your Pro Form Shortcode ( `captcha="clean"` ).

= Is s2Member compatible with Multisite Networking ? =
Yes. s2Member, and also s2Member Pro, are BOTH compatible with Multisite Networking enabled. After you enable Multisite Networking, install the s2Member plugin. Then navigate to `s2Member -> Multisite ( Config )` in the Dashboard on your ( Main Site ). If you're running WordPress® 3.1+, you'll find this in your Network Administration panel.

= What if I have other questions not covered here? =
The [forum](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=4) for s2Member is available [here](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=4). Many [common questions/problems/tips](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=36) are discussed [here](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=36).

= Can s2Member be translated into other languages? =
Yes. s2Member and s2Member Pro are now equipped with support for front-end translation, using standardized WordPress® methodologies; i.e. we've implemented the use of `_x()`, and various other translation routines for many aspects of s2Member's front-end interfaces. For instance, things like Profile panels, Login/Registration Fields, and Pro Form integrations; as well as error messages displayed to Users/Members. Translation support for back-end admin panels provided by s2Member will come in a future release, along with more extensive translation support for front-end aspects.

Please note, this is but our first step toward internationalizing s2Member and s2Member Pro. Look for further updates/improvements to come in the future.

Like WordPress® itself, we chose to use the GNU `gettext` localization framework to provide localization infrastructure for s2Member®. GNU `gettext` is a mature, widely used framework for modular translation of software, and is the *de facto* standard for localization in the open source/free software realm. If you'd like to translate s2Member and/or s2Member Pro, please use the POT file found inside `/s2member/includes/translations/s2member.pot`, which contains all translation entries for both the s2Member Framework *( i.e. the free version )*, and also for s2Member Pro.

The file: `/s2member/includes/translations/s2member.pot` will be updated with each new release of s2Member.

If this is your first translation of a WordPress® plugin, [this article](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress#Localization_Technology) and/or [this article](http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/translating-wordpress-themes-and-plugins/), might be of some assistance. When you are finished translating the `s2member.pot` file, place your completed `s2member-[locale].mo` file into this directory: `/wp-content/plugins/`; and please feel free to [share your translation](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=4) with the rest of the s2Member® community.

Quick Tip: If you only need to translate the front-end of s2Member, please ignore entries in the `s2member.pot` file with a context matching `s2member-admin`. Those sections of s2Member are only seen by site Administrators; they are NOT used in s2Member's front-end integration with WordPress®. Skipping over translation entries with a context matching `s2member-admin` can save you time.

For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15232&p=41707#p41707).

= v111105 =
* (s2Member Pro) **New feature**. It is now possible to configure Coupon Codes that are ONLY valid on specific Pages/Posts which may hold one of your s2Member Pro Forms. For further details, please check the examples in your Dashboard, here: `s2Member -> Pro Coupon Codes`.
* (s2Member Pro) **New feature**. Affiliate Coupon Codes make it possible for your affiliates to receive credit for sales they refer, using one of your Coupon Codes. Here's how it works. You tell your affiliates about one or more of the Coupon Codes that you accept. Each of your affiliates can add their affiliate ID onto the end of any valid Coupon Code, like this: `COUPON-CODE-A:123`; where `COUPON-CODE` is the valid Coupon Code that you've configured, and `123` is the affiliate's ID. If a Customer comes to your site, and they use a Coupon Code with an affiliate ID on the end of it; your affiliate will be tracked automatically by s2Member. If this Customer actually completes the sale, the referring affiliate will be credited with whatever commission your affiliate program offers. For further details, please check the examples in your Dashboard, here: `s2Member -> Pro Coupon Codes -> Affiliate Coupon Codes`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **New feature**. It is now possible to protect `all` Posts, but only of a specific Post Type. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Restriction Options -> Post Level Access Restrictions`.
* (s2Member Pro) **Improvement**. The s2Member Pro Login Widget now has improved handling of its `%%previous%%` Replacement Code for login redirections. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15522&p=48448#p48515).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **MOP Vars improved**. s2Member MOP Vars ( Membership Options Page Variables ), have been improved in this release. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API / Scripting -> Membership Options Page (Variables)`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **bbPress®**. Dropped legacy support for bbPress® stand-alone version. s2Member still supports the WordPress® plugin version of bbPress® v2.0+. However, from this version forward, we will no longer support the legacy s2Member Bridge to the stand-alone version of bbPress®. If you've already installed the s2Member Bridge for the stand-alone version of bbPress®, using a previous release of s2Member, your s2Member Bridge plugin should continue to work. However, the s2Member bbPress® Bridge is no longer included with s2Member, and we will not support the stand-alone version of bbPress® from this point forward.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. s2Member function `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_gets::get_all_post_ids()` was not properly excluding Post Type `nav_menu_item`. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. s2Member function `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_gets::get_all_child_category_ids()` was not including empty terms. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. s2Member function `c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_gets::get_all_tag_ids()` was not including empty terms. Fixed in this release.

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **WordPress® 3.3-beta2**. Compatibility updates for the coming release of WordPress® 3.3.

= v111029 =
* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. s2Member Pro now supports automatic upgrades through filesystem methdologies, other than `direct`. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15283#p49034).
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. A bug in the s2Member framework was causing some IPNs with `txn_type = recurring_payment_suspended_due_to_max_failed_payment` to get bypassed inadvertently. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=6204&p=48246#p48361).
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug in s2Member Pro's AliPay® integration was causing an error `could not find existing User ID`. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15569&p=49044#p48604).
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug in s2Member Pro's AliPay® integration was causing issues in duplicate IPNs received from AliPay®. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. File Downloads. s2Member now considers server software environments before chunking file downloads, avoiding issues with partially corrupted files on some hosting platforms. In addition, s2Member is now capable of falling back on a flushed delivery method so it can continue to avoid memory issues on shared hosting accounts, even when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is not possible. These improvements allow s2Member to remain compatible in edge cases. Such as when running on Litespeed and/or Windows servers; or on shared hosting platforms that have fewer resources available.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Automatic upgrader failing on `copy` command when running at HostGator. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Security fix**. The `/s2member-files/` directory *(with newly updated Mod Rewrite rules in its .htaccess file)* was allowing directory indexing inadvertently, on some servers. This was a low-level vulnerability, because although directory indexing was possible, protected file access was not. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15665&p=48984&hilit=next+release#p48984).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug related to the `init()` Hook firing an early call to `c_ws_plugin__s2member_systematics::is_wp_systematic_use_page()` was identified. Fixed in this release. One symptom of this bug was for Users/Members to have trouble accessing a BuddyPress registration form after having paid for Membership, under the right scenario.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **New API Functions**. New API Functions: `s2member_shorten_url()`, `s2member_user_downloads()`, `s2member_total_downloads_of()`, and `s2member_total_unique_downloads_of()`. For further details, please check the [s2Member Codex](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=12455).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Routine maintenance**. Some code optimization, some cleanup, and some organizational improvements in preparation for new features in a coming release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **WordPress® 3.3-beta2**. Compatibility updates. CSS tweaks, JavaScript tweaks and other considerations for the coming release of WordPress® 3.3.

= v111017 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. s2Member now works around a known bug in PHP, related to the `parse_url()` function. For further details, please see [this PHP bug report](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=38143).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Improvements to s2Member's `wp_mail()` conformity, related to the reducton of `"Name" <email>` to just `email`. This release should work to further improve email deliverability in edge cases, particulary on sites running an SMTP mail plugin.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Improvements to s2Member's JW Player® integration. s2Member now prevents `unreserved chars`, i.e. `array ("-", ".", "_", "~")` from being URL-encoded in file download URLs, maximizing compatibility with many media players, including JW Player®. In previous releases, JW Player® would randomly fail on some RTMP streams with error `Stream Not Found`. Fixed in this release, with [one exception](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=286182&#286182). For further details, see [RFC 3896](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3986.html).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Initial testing against WordPress v3.3-beta1. Looks pretty good. A few minor cosmetic issues still need to be addressed in a future release of s2Member though.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Tested against BuddyPress v1.5.1. Updated s2Member to support `$bp->maintenance_mode`, and other cases where `bp_core_loaded` is NOT fired at all.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Routine maintenance**. Some code optimization, some cleanup, and some organizational improvements in preparation for new features in a coming release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Edge case identified where the `/s2member-o.php` file was failing to fallback on full WordPress®. Fixed in this release.

= v111011 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. An array to string conversion error was found in Profile editing panels whenever a multi-option Select Menu was created as a Custom Registration/Profile Field with s2Member. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15416&p=44801#p45169).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Email recipients / compatibility fix**. A bug found by an s2Member Pro customer, related to PHP's `mail()` function in PHP 5.2 < 5.2.11 was preventing some email messages from being processed properly. Fixed in this release. For further details, see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=14957#p45222) and/or [this PHP bug report](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=28038) please.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. s2Member was redirecting logged-in Users/Members to the Download Limit Exceeded Page whenever an attempt to download a file was made by a User/Member with access at a Level that was NOT allowed to access files period. s2Member should have been redirecting these specific requests to the Membership Options Page instead, with MOP Vars included. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15367#p45122).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Documentation updates**. s2Member's built-in Dashboard documentation has been updated in several places. This should work to further help site owners that are new to s2Member. In addition, s2Member's inline documentation now includes tips for integrating BuddyPress, when/if BuddyPress is installed and activated in your WordPress® installation.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Logging**. s2Member now adds the currently installed version of PHP to its log entries, if logging is enabled by the site owner.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **AWeber**. A bug was found in s2Member's AWeber integration. When/if you configured s2Member NOT to collect First/Last Names, the email subscription request was not being parsed properly on the AWeber side of things, due to a regex issue in their built-in PayPal Email Parser. Fixed in this release. In addition, s2Member has built a Custom Email Parser for AWeber, which is optional, but definitely recommended. Please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=15496) for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug was found in s2Member's email configuration routine, which made it possible *( based on other plugin combinations running in concert with s2Member )*, for s2Member to drop existing `mail_from` values configured by other plugins, which may have resulted in delivery failures, particularly when/if a site was configured to use an external SMTP server, which MAY require that your `From:` header reference a specific address, one that is directly associated with your external SMTP account. Fixed in this release. In addition, please be advised that if you run an SMTP mail plugin with WordPress®, you should be sure to configure your `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration` with a valid `From:` address *( i.e. one matching your SMTP configuration perhaps )*. Most free SMTP servers, such as Gmail/Yahoo, require that your `From:` header match the email address associated with your account. Please check with your SMTP service provider before attempting to configure plugins like s2Member to use a different `From:` address when sending email messages. For further details, please check your Dashboad, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **MailChimp®/AWeber® list transitioning**. s2Member's list transitioning routine ( an optional feature ) has been further optimized and improved. In addition, it is now possible to force the transition of Users/Members from one set of lists to another, even when s2Member is unable to remove them from an existing list. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API List Servers -> Automate Unsubscribe / Opt-Outs`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Reset or lock-in Roles/Capabilities**. A new development tool is available in your Dashboard, which makes it possible for developers to reset and/or lock-in the Roles/Capabilities associated with s2Member. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Membership Levels/Labels`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Routine maintenance**. Some code optimization, some cleanup, and some organizational improvements in preparation for new features in a coming release.

= v111003 =
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. Fatal `eval()` error inside: `/includes/classes/no-cache.inc.php`. Fixed in this release.

= v111002 =
* (s2Member) **BuddyPress v1.5 fix**. Issues with BuddyPress v1.5 and s2Member's URI Restrictions; corrected in this release. Hook priority updated, and `template_redirect` converted to `wp` at priority `2`, giving s2Member the ability to integrate with BuddyPress v1.5 properly in all scenarios.
* (s2Member) **tinyURL® bug fix**. s2Member's handling of potential failures in the output of tinyURLs, generated by the tinyURL® API; was NOT considering all failure possibilities. A symptom of this bug was to see URLs in your Signup Confirmation Email (occassionally, upon connection failure to the tinyURL® API, when it was down for whatever reason) starting with: `Error#`. Corrected in this release.
* (s2Member) **URL Shortening API (Preference)**. s2Member now includes a class method dedicated to URL shortening service APIs. Currently, s2Member will use the tinyURL® API first *(i.e. tinyurl.com )*, and then use the Google® URL Shortening API *(i.e. goo.gl )* as a backup when/if the tinyURL® API is down for whatever reason. In this release, a new configurable option is available, which allows advanced site owners to preference the Google® Shortening API over tinyURL®, if they desire. It is also possible to integrate your own custom GET request, for whichever service you prefer. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> URL Shortening API (Preference)`.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. Bug first introduced in s2Member v110912. s2Member's new optimized method of loading its CSS/JS was causing some problems on a few Windows® server environments. In some cases, s2Member was unable to properly identify itself through the `/s2member-o.php` file, given limitations of the core WordPress® function `plugin_basename()`. A symptom of this bug was for s2Member to fail at loading its CSS/JS libraries. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **Security fix**. It was possible for some of s2Member's code sample files to be executed directly. Not a proven vulnerability, but definitely NOT a good idea to allow this either. Fixed in this release, by renaming all `.php` files inside the `/includes/menu-pages/code-samples/` directory. These files now have a `.x-php` extension. As an additional line of defense, a new `.htaccess` file with `deny from all` is automatically placed inside the main `/s2member/includes/` directory. None of these files should be available pulicly anyway. s2Member's exsiting `realpath()` file scans remain in place too, which further prevents the direct execution of `.php` files.

= v110927 =
* (s2Member) **BuddyPress v1.5 compatibility**. Misc tweaks.
* (s2Member) **Documentation improvements**. New documentation covering Shortcode Attributes and API Function parameters for the new `[s2File /]` Shortcode, and for the new API Function `s2member_file_download_url()`. Please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Shortcode Attributes / API Functions ( Explained )`.

= v110926 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **BuddyPress v1.5**. Updated for compatibility with BuddyPress v1.5.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug first introduced in s2Member Pro v110912 was causing problems for Pro Forms integrated on a Child Blog of Multisite Blog Farm. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Custom Registration/Profile Fields configured to require an EXACT number of characters and/or digits was NOT being handled properly by s2Member in all cases. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug first introduced in s2Member v110912 was causing problems with s2Member's default email customization templates. Double percent signs `%%` for Replacement Codes were being reduced by s2Member's internationalization routines, to just single percent signs `%`, thereby nullifying them as valid Replacement Codes. Fixed in this release. If you installed s2Member and/or s2Member Pro v110912 - v110915 on a clean installation of WordPress®, it would be a good idea to have a quick look at your email customizations with s2Member, just to make sure your Replacement Codes have double percent signs around them *( for example, this is valid: `%%registration_url%%`, and this is NOT valid: `%registration_url%` )*.
* (s2Member) **Amazon® S3/CloudFront**. s2Member is now fully integrated with Amazon® CloudFront, in addition to its existing support for Amazon® S3. Please note, one of the greatest things about Amazon® CloudFront, is its ability to `stream/seek` media files in the truest sense of the word over the RTMP protocol. For sites delivering protected `FLV/MP4/OGG/WEBM` and other streaming audio/video file types over the RTMP protocol, Amazon® CloudFront is our recommendation. Once you've successfully configured s2Member to use both Amazon® S3 and Amazon® CloudFront together, please review this section in your Dashboard: `s2Member -> Download Options -> JW Player® & RTMP Protocol Examples`. s2Member will automatically serve your protected files over the RTMP protocol, using an Amazon® CloudFront Streaming Distribution. In fact, s2Member can even configure all of your Amazon® S3/CloudFront Distros, ACLs, and Policies automatically; making it possible for just about anyone to stream media s2Member-protected files in real-time.
* (s2Member) **s2File Shortcode**. s2Member now provides a new Shortcode: `[s2File /]`. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Basic Download Restrictions`.

= v110915 =
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. A bug first introduced in s2Member/s2Member Pro v110912+ was causing parse errors on Authorize.Net Free Regisration Forms. Fixed in this release.

= v110913 =
* (s2Member) **Compatibility**. s2Member v110912+ requires WordPress® v3.2+.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix**. A bug first introduced in s2Member v110912 related to JavaScript/CSS files not loading properly on some installations has been corrected in this release. One symptom of this bug was s2Member's failure to display Pro Form integrations properly in some cases. Another symptom may have been improper handling of Registration Form validations.
* (s2Member) **HostGator**. Tildas ( `~` ) found in some encrypted data strings were triggering `mod_security` conflicts on sites powered by HostGator. This release corrects the problem on HostGator by stripping tildas from query strings processed by s2Member. In addition, HostGator has been very helpful in white-listing the s2Member application across its entire network to prevent interruption of service. For further details, please check [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=14787#p35909).

= v110912 =
* (s2Member) **Compatibility**. This version of s2Member requires WordPress® v3.2+.
* (s2Member) **Alternative View Protections**. s2Member's Alternative View Protections are now more flexible, allowing specific types of Protections to be applied individually now, instead of in groups. In addition, there are two new types of Alternative View Protection available: Comment Feeds (new), and WordPress® Navigation Menus (new). For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Restriction Options -> Alternative View Protections`.
* (s2Member Pro) **Independent Custom Capabilities**. The integration of Independent Custom Capabilities from the last release, has now been completed for all of s2Member's Payment Gateways. In this release, we completed Independent Custom Capability integration for ClickBank®, Google® Checkout, ccBill®, and AliPay®. Independent Custom Capabilities are already possible with PayPal®, PayPal® Pro, and Authorize.Net®, from the last release. Further improvements to this aspect of s2Member Pro will come in a future release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Security**. Back-end panels for both s2Member and s2Member Pro have been updated to use `password` input fields, anywhere/everywhere sensitive data is being configured. This helps to further safeguard various API and Payment Gateway credentials on your installation of WordPress®. In other words, some sensitive data that you configure for s2Member, will now appear with just x's `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, instead of the actual data that you entered; *( e.g. `password` input fields secure this information from prying eyes )*.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Translation Support**. s2Member and s2Member Pro are now equipped with support for front-end translation, using standardized WordPress® methodologies; i.e. we've implemented the use of `_x()`, and various other translation routines for many aspects of s2Member's front-end interfaces. For instance, things like Profile panels, Login/Registration Fields, and Pro Form integrations; as well as error messages displayed to Users/Members. Translation support for back-end admin panels provided by s2Member will come in a future release, along with more extensive translation support for front-end aspects.
 
 Please note, this is but our first step toward internationalizing s2Member and s2Member Pro. Look for further updates/improvements to come in the future.
 
 Like WordPress® itself, we chose to use the GNU `gettext` localization framework to provide localization infrastructure for s2Member®. GNU `gettext` is a mature, widely used framework for modular translation of software, and is the *de facto* standard for localization in the open source/free software realm. If you'd like to translate s2Member and/or s2Member Pro, please use the POT file found inside `/s2member/includes/translations/s2member.pot`, which contains all translation entries for both the s2Member Framework *( i.e. the free version )*, and also for s2Member Pro.
 
 The file: `/s2member/includes/translations/s2member.pot` will be updated with each new release of s2Member.
 If this is your first translation of a WordPress® plugin, [this article](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress#Localization_Technology) and/or [this article](http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/translating-wordpress-themes-and-plugins/), might be of some assistance. When you are finished translating the `s2member.pot` file, place your completed `s2member-[locale].mo` file into this directory: `/wp-content/plugins/`; and please feel free to [share your translation](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=4) with the rest of the s2Member® community.
 
 Quick Tip: If you only need to translate the front-end of s2Member, please ignore entries in the `s2member.pot` file with a context matching `s2member-admin`. Those sections of s2Member are only seen by site Administrators; they are NOT used in s2Member's front-end integration with WordPress®. Skipping over translation entries with a context matching `s2member-admin` can save you time.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix / Multisite**. A bug fix related to site creation within the Dashboard on a Multisite Blog Farm, has been corrected in this release. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=10307#p32628).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. New Filter added to s2Member's source code, allowing s2Member Pro site owners to enable/disable tab indexing of reCAPTCHA box controllers *( e.g. the three mundane buttons )* that are skipped over 99.9% of the time anyway. If you'd like to enable tab indexing on these buttons, use: `add_filter("c_ws_plugin__s2member_utils_tabindex_recaptcha_icons", "__return_true");` inside a `/wp-content/mu-plugins/s2-hacks.php` file.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix**. Some site owners running s2Member Pro, on server configurations with PHP-based output compression enabled, experienced problems with the `success=""` Shortcode Attribute for s2Member Pro Forms. s2Member Pro has been improved in this regard *( i.e. s2Member Pro now makes better attempts to clear output buffers before returning plain text data with it's handlers )*. In addition, calls to `trim()` have also been implemented as an additional line of defense against errors reported in the previous release; which were related to URLs with leading white space, returned by s2Member's core PayPal® IPN processor.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Conformity**. s2Member and s2Member Pro now make use of a core WordPress® function for all HTTP status headers ( i.e. `status_header(xxx)` ).
* (s2Member Pro) **Pro Forms / Tabindex ( Bug fix )**. s2Member Pro Forms suffered from a bug related to `tabindex` conflicts whenever MANY Custom Registration/Profile Fields were configured together. Corrected in this release.
* (s2Member Pro) **Google® Checkout ( Bug fix )**. s2Member Pro's integration with Google Checkout has been updated in this release to use `display-disposition: PESSIMISTIC` instead of `OPTIMISTIC`. This change prevents possible card declines from slipping through, and thereby granting a Customer access inadvertently. With the former `OPTIMISTIC` behavior, in rare cases when payment authorizaton at Google® Checkout took longer than 20 seconds, s2Member was giving a Customer access to the site, instead of waiting pessimistically for Google® Checkout to complete processing. The updated behavior, now set to `PESSIMISTIC`, prevents this from occurring. For technical details, see [this article](http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/Google_Checkout_Digital_Delivery.html).
* (s2Member Pro) **ClickBank® ( Bug fix )**. s2Member Pro's integration with ClickBank® has been updated in this release. A bug was found by WebSharks, Inc. Support Rep: Cristián Lávaque, related to the verification of POST vars. Whenever UTF-8 characters appeared in any part of a ClickBank® IPN response received by s2Member, s2Member was failing to verify the checksum, and thus, returning the error: `POST vars could not be verified`. This issue has been corrected in the latest release of s2Member Pro. In addition, a known bug with ClickBank® cutting off first/last names whenever special characters were part of either name, has now been side-stepped by s2Member Pro's integration with ClickBank®.
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal® ( Bug fix )**. s2Member Pro's integration with the PayPal® Pro API has been updated in this release. A bug was found by the s2Member community which affected a rare scenario during heavy testing. When/if a site owner was heavily testing s2Member Pro Forms repeatedly, whereby PayPal® Pro Recurring Profiles were created over and over again; one of these Recurring Profiles could still be in a `Pending` state during a Subscription Modification soon thereafter. This is rare, because Recurring Profiles are usually in a `Pending` state on the PayPal® side of things, for just a few seconds. However, in this test case, it was possible for s2Member to create a second Recurring Profile through the PayPal® Pro API, and the old one would NOT be terminated properly, because it was still in a `Pending` state, and unable to be terminated. This release of s2Member Pro resolves this issue and prevents this from occuring under any scenario. Customers and/or site owners testing s2Member Pro Forms will now see an error message related to pending changes, and the Customer would be asked to wait 15 minutes in this rare scenario.
* (s2Member) **Protected Files**. This version of s2Member updates the `.htaccess` file in your `/s2member-files/` directory with `mod_rewrite` rules which provide additional flexibility in the way protected files are served to your Customers. With the new `mod_rewrite` rules, it is now possible to link directly to a protected file, avoiding the use of query string variables *( it's completely optional though )*.

 In other words, this update adds new functionality, it does NOT change anything that already existed. This new flexibility may come in handy for site owners serving files through media playback devices that have issues with query string variables. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Advanced Mod Rewrite Linkage`.
 
 Dev note. Any existing `.htaccess` file inside your `/s2member-files/` directory will be overwritten by this release, as it should be. However, if you'd like s2Member to preserve a custom `.htaccess` file that you've written, please create this directory and file: `/wp-content/mu-plugins/s2-hacks.php`, and put this inside it: `<?php add_filter("ws_plugin__s2member_preserve_files_dir_htaccess", "__return_true"); ?>`. Please do this before you upgrade, if this is your intention.
* (s2Member) **Download Keys**. There is now a Shortcode equivalent to s2Member's API function `s2member_file_download_key($file, $directive)`. You can now do this in this WordPress® Visual Editor if you prefer: `[s2Key file_download="example-file.zip" /]` without needing a PHP Execution plugin.

 For those of you that use the optional `$directive` parameter, you can do something like this: `[s2Key file_download="example-file.zip" directive="ip-forever|universal" /]`. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Download Options -> Advanced Download Restrictions`. Or see [this article](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=12453#src_doc_s2member_file_download_key%28%29) in the s2Member Codex.
* (s2Member) **Localhost Installs**. s2Member now includes information for site owners developing in a `localhost` environment, with WAMP/MAMP or something like EasyPHP. Instructions are now easier to find. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Localhost WAMP/MAMP Developers`.
* (s2Member) **PayPal® ( Bug fix )**. s2Member was incorrectly handling delayed EOT Times under a specific scenario, as [reported here](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=14876&p=34414#p34414). Corrected in this release.
* (s2Member) **JavaScript/CSS Optimization**. s2Member now loads its dynamic JavaScript/CSS libraries through a new optimized file called `/s2member-o.php`, designed to increase the speed at which your installation of WordPress® can load these resources. The new optimized `/s2member-o.php` file loads only the core WordPress® framework and the s2Member JavaScript and/or CSS file, depending on which is being requested. This new file will eliminate a potential bottleneck on some WordPress® installations, which may have MANY other plugins running in concert with s2Member. It also works to further reduce CPU and memory consumption for all site owners. For further details about why this optimization is beneficial, please see [this article](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=14359&p=33441#p33441).
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal® Express Checkout / Pre-Population**. s2Member now pre-populates everything it can through PayPal® Express Checkout integration. If a Customer does NOT already have a PayPal® account when they arrive at Express Checkout, the Account Creation Form at PayPal® will be pre-populated with a minimum of their Name and Email Address. Street address information will ONLY be pre-populated, when/if s2Member collects it for tax purposes. Otherwise, the address information will NOT be pre-populated, because only PayPal® will ask for those details anyway *( i.e. s2Member doesn't ask for address details when Express Checkout is used; not unless you're collecting taxes: `s2Member -> PayPal® Options -> Tax Calculations` ).
* (s2Member) **New API Function**. This version of s2Member includes a new API Function `get_s2member_custom_fields()`, designed to provide more information about Custom Registration/Profile Field configuration and values for a specific User. The API function `get_user_field()` remains available as well. For further details, please see [this article](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=12455) in the s2Member Codex.
* (s2Member Pro) **Pro Login Widget**. This version of s2Member improves the `%%automatic%%` setting for the Signup URL in Pro Login Widgets. When/if a Customer has already paid for their Membership, the Signup URL presented in the Pro Login Widget will change dynamically, pointing a Customer to the Registration Form, instead of to your Membership Options Page. Of course, this behavior could be overridden by changing the Signup URL to something other than `%%automatic%%`, if you prefer.

= v110815 =
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Independent Custom Capabilities.** You can now sell one or more Custom Capabilities using Buy Now functionality, to "existing" Users/Members, regardless of which Membership Level they have on your site *( i.e. you could even sell Independent Custom Capabilities to Users at Membership Level #0, normally referred to as Free Subscribers, if you like )*. So this is quite flexible. Independent Custom Capabilities do NOT rely on any specific Membership Level. That's why s2Member refers to these as *Independent* Custom Capabilities, because you can sell Capabilities this way, through Buy Now functionality, and the Customer's Membership Level Access, along with any existing paid Subscription they may already have with you, will remain completely unaffected. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> PayPal® Buttons -> Capability (Buy Now) Buttons`. Independent Custom Capabilities are currently integrated with PayPal® Standard Buttons, PayPal® Pro Forms, and Authorize.Net® Pro Forms only. Integration with other Payment Gateways supported by s2Member Pro will come in a future release.
* (s2Member) **API Tracking.** This release of s2Member introduces two new API Tracking methods, now making it possible to incorporate Tracking Codes *( i.e. affiliate program integrations, as one example )* for `Signup Tracking`, `Modification Tracking (new)`, and also for `Capability Tracking (new)`. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API Tracking`. These new methods are ( in addition to ) s2Member's API Notifications, which remain available. s2Member's API Notifications are intended for more advanced tracking integrations, such as a 3rd-party call through an HTTP request.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix / Multisite.** s2Member's supplemental API Functions `current_user_is()`, `current_user_is_not()` and the `..for_blog()` alternatives, were not properly considering Super Administators on a Multisite Network installation. On a Multisite Network, the WordPress `$user->has_cap()` routine returns true for anything passed in on a Super Administrator account, causing s2Member's `user_is` API Functions to return true for Super Administrators in some cases, when it really should NOT have been. Fixed in this release. If you need to use `current_user_is()` against a Super Administrator, the `user_is` API Functions introduced by s2Member will only return true in these special cases: `current_user_is("super_administrator")` and/or `current_user_is("administrator")`. Super Administrators should always have the `administrator` Role, for all Blogs in the Network, and s2Member will also consider the fake Role `super_administrator` *( unique to s2Member )* for cases when you need to test explicity for a Super Administrator. Actually, you could also just use the WordPress core function for this: `is_super_admin()` *( recommended )*.
* (s2Member) **Bug fix / Capabilities.** When/if you require Custom Capabilities in order to view certain content sections on your site, s2Member was behaving properly in all cases, except for one specific scenario. When an Administrator of the site *( on a normal single-site installation of WordPress )*, was attempting to test-view content protected with Custom Capabilities *( this scenario was causing a problem )*. What was happening, is that s2Member was seeing that an Adminstrator did not have certain Custom Capabilities defined explicity in their account, and access was being denied *( that's actually, NOT right )*. This was in conflict with the way that s2Member handles all other content protection routines with respect to Administrators. Administrators should automatically have access to all protected content, even if Custom Capabilities are not explicity defined in their account. After all, they are Administrators. In short, this release makes it possible for Administrators of a single-site WordPress installation, to have full access to all content; even when/if Custom Capabilities are required. This should help to prevent confusion for site owners just beginning to understand s2Member's functionality with respect to Custom Capabilities.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug fix / Coupon Codes.** s2Member Pro Forms were failing to apply Coupon Codes properly in some cases. Whenever a Coupon Code eliminated all initial charges for a Trial Amount, s2Member was attempting to charge a zero dollar sale amount, under the right scenario. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **API Notifications.** Starting with this release, s2Member's Payment Notifications are also triggered whenever a Buy Now purchase for Independent Custom Capabilities takes place (new). The documentation in your Dashboard has been updated. For further details, please see: `s2Member -> API Notifications -> Payment Notifications`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Cookies.** Both s2Member and s2Member Pro now fully support the `COOKIEPATH`, `SITECOOKIEPATH`, and `COOKIE_DOMAIN` constants from the WordPress® core, making s2Member more secure on Multisite Networks, and improving compatibility overall for sites that use one or more of these PHP Constants in their `/wp-config.php` file.
* (s2Member Pro) **UI Improvement / tabindex.** s2Member Pro Forms have been updated to skip tab indexes on reCAPTCHA box controllers *( e.g. the three mundane buttons )* that are skipped over 99.9% of the time anyway. This allows Pro Form tab controls to jump immediately to the reCAPTCHA input field, if/when enabled by your Shortcode.
* (s2Member Pro) **UI Improvement.** s2Member\'s live feed inside your Dashboard, which is responsible for delivering updates that come from Lead Developer Jason Caldwell and s2Member Support Reps, has been improved in this release. You'll see this on the right-hand side of s2Member's UI panels, near the top.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Capability Additions (Changed).** In previous versions of s2Member, when generating a Payment Button/Form, it was possible to precede your list of Custom Capabilities with a `+` sign, indicating that you wish to (Add) new Custom Capabilities instead of (Resetting) a User's Capbilities to the ones you list. Starting with this release, (Add) is now the default behavior. In other words, the `+` sign is no longer required, because s2Member will automatically (Add) Capabilities to any that already exist for a particular User/Member, even without the `+` sign *(no longer required)*. In addition, there is now a new directive available: `-all`. You may now precede your list of Custom Capabilities with `-all`, but only if you wish to (Remove/Reset) all Custom Capabilities, and then (Add) new ones. For example: `-all,music,videos`, would remove any existing Custom Capabilities that may or may not already exist for a particular User/Member, and then add: `music,videos`. There are additional examples provided by the Payment Button/Form Generators that come with s2Member. Please check your Dashboard if you'd like to learn more.
* (s2Member) **Compatibility.** s2Member's ability to modify the WordPress® Admin Bar for Users/Members has been updated to fully support WordPress® v3.2+. This feature now behaves as expected in the latest release. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Profile Modifications`. The Redirection option in that section, has the side effect of manipulating the Admin Bar across the top of your site *( if enabled )*, making WordPress® behave properly.
* (s2Member Pro) **Options Import/Export.** s2Member Pro now makes it possible to export your s2Member options, in their entirety, and then import them into another instance of WordPress®. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Import/Export`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Memory.** Memory reporting is now added to log entries by s2Member.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **JavaScript.** Minor optimization of s2Member's JavaScript routine.

= v110812 =
* (s2Member) **Security fix.** This release addresses an important security vulnerability in previous releases of the s2Member Framework *( i.e. the free version of s2Member )*. Sites with Download Options configured for s2Member should be advised to update to s2Member v110812+ as soon as possible to avoid possible exploits.

= v110731 =
* **(s2Member) Bug fix / Multisite.** In the Multisite (Config) panel, s2Member was not properly displaying the number of Blogs allowed at Level #0, in some cases.
* **(s2Member Pro) Update / ClickBank®.** s2Member Pro has been updated to better support ClickBank's policy on Thank-You Pages. s2Member now provides a link on the ClickBank Return-Page where Customers may contact your support department, and a message regarding charges on a Customer's bank statement appearing as `CLKBANK*COM`. This is mandatory for all ClickBank® integrations. ClickBank® will not approve your Products without this information on the Thank-You Page integrated with s2Member. In addition, s2Member now makes it possible to customize your Thank-You Page for ClickBank®. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> ClickBank® Options -> Thank-You Page`. If you have attempted to use temporary hacks of your own in order to avoid issues with ClickBank® policy in this regard, we suggest that you remove those hacks, and instead work with the new features introduced in this release of s2Member Pro. If you need assistance, please use the s2Member forums.
* **(s2Member Pro) Pro API For Remote Operations.** With s2Member Pro installed, you now have access to the s2Member Pro API For Remote Operations. This is made available for developers that wish to create User/Member accounts dynamically through custom scripts of their own. s2Member's Remote Operations API requires a secret API Key in order to POST authenticated requests to your installation of s2Member. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API Scripting -> Remote Operations API`.
* **(s2Member) Compatibility.** In cases where a site owner integrates Amazon® S3 file storage for protected File Downloads, with an invalid Bucket name which contains mixed caSe ( that's a no-no anyway ), s2Member will now convert the Amazon® S3 connection URL to `s3.amazonaws.com/[BUCKET]`, instead of the default `[bucket].s3.amazonaws.com`. This is required for invalid Bucket names which use mixed caSe. The only way for Amazon® S3 communication to work with these invalid Bucket names, is with a sub-folder URL. See docs on [Bucket names](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?BucketRestrictions.html).
* **(s2Member) Feature Improvement.** s2Member's API Tracking Codes are now displayed immediately after checkout in all possible scenarios. This is an improvement over past versions, where s2Member sometimes had to await IPN processing before Tracking Codes integrated with s2Member could be displayed on-site. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> API Tracking`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) New Feature / Thank-You Page Templates.** s2Member's Return Page handlers ( aka: Thank-You Page handlers ) have been improved. Instead of using a JavaScript alert immediately after checkout, s2Member now displays all responses with pure HTML. In addition, with s2Member Pro installed ( and only with s2Member Pro installed ), it is now possible to customize the header section ( i.e the top ) of your Thank-You Page from the Dashboard, and/or to create a custom template file inside your active WordPress® theme directory for each Payment Gateway integrated with s2Member ( all optional ). For details on your PayPal Return Page ( aka: Thank-You Page ), please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> PayPal Options -> Auto-Return/PDT Integration -> Auto-Return Page Template`.
 
 The ability to customize the Return Page is now possible ( for all applicable Payment Gateways ) integrated with s2Member Pro, including: PayPal® Standard, ClickBank®, ccBill®, and AliPay®. Other Payment Gateways, such as: PayPal® Pro, Authorize.Net®, and Google® Checkout do NOT require a Return-Page anyway, so they are NOT applicable in this regard.
 
 *Please note, this feature improvement should NOT negatively impact any existing installations of s2Member. In other words, you don't need to change anything in your existing installation, unless you want to. Custom Return Page templates are completely optional. This improvement simply makes new things possible in s2Member Pro, and even provides a smoother experience for all Customers completing checkout through the free version of s2Member. If you need to customize s2Member's default Return-Page Template, please upgrade to s2Member Pro, where the tools for this are made available in your Dashboard.*
* **(s2Member) New Feature / Login Counter.** Starting with this release, s2Member will automatically monitor the number of times each User/Member logs into your site. This information is made visible to the site owner in the list of Users ( i.e. in the Dashboard ). This information is also used as the basis for a new feature in s2Member Pro, which allows for the configuration of One-Time-Offers, based on the number of previous logins at your site. For further details, please check your Dashboard with s2Member Pro installed, see: `s2Member -> General Options -> One-Time-Offers`.
* **(s2Member Pro) Feature Improvement / Success Attribute.** With s2Member Pro installed, it is also possible to completely override the Standard Return-Page handlers with the `success=""` Attribute in your Shortcode. This works with PayPal® Standard integration, and also for AliPay®. New in this release, It is now possible to achieve the same result with ClickBank® and ccBill® too, using the instructions provided in your s2Member options panel, for each respective Gateway. Also, this release of s2Member improves the handling of custom Return URLs.

 In all cases, s2Member will now ALWAYS handle the initial redirection after checkout, where s2Member sets important authorization cookies, and THEN ( if configured to do so ) redirect to your custom URL on success. This prevents issues with registration authorization cookies not being set properly when/if custom Success URLs are used. This was a problematic area in previous releases of s2Member, and this version should resolve those issues; as long as the updated instructions are followed inside your Dashboard. For example, with ClickBank®, please see: `s2Member -> ClickBank® Options -> Thank-You Page -> Thank-You Page Templates` for full details regarding all possible customizations. You will find similar instructions for other Payment Gateways integrated with s2Member.
* **(s2Member Pro) New Feature / One-Time-Offers.** With s2Member Pro installed, it is now possible to configure One-Time-Offers ( Upon Login ). This feature allows site owners to display a different page the 1st time a User/Member logs in ( and more ), and/or to create loyaltly rewards/offers for Users/Members who have been very active on their account. For further details, please check your Dashboard with s2Member Pro installed, see: `s2Member -> General Options -> One-Time-Offers`.
* **(s2Member) Bug fix. BuddyPress Profile Fields.** s2Member's integration with BuddyPress Profile fields was invalid in cases where public Profiles were being viewed/edited while another User was logged in. s2Member was displaying/populating the current User's Custom Field data in places where it should have been pulling details based on `$bp->displayed_user->id`. This bug has been corrected in this release of s2Member.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Code Restructuring / Security Hardening.** s2Member's core IPN and Return-Page handlers have been reorganized into sub-classes containing conditional phases. This made it possibe to harden s2Member's security in various ways, and also sets the groundwork for new features ( coming soon ). One way in which s2Member's security had been hardended in this release, is that it's now harder, if not impossible, for s2Member to reprocess any IPN and/or Return-Page Data in duplicate. In rare cases where information comes through in duplicate, s2Member will ignore dupes completely, recover gracefully, log important details, and/or display `Page Expired` notifications to possible attackers.
* **(s2Member Pro) Bug fix. Authorize.Net® ARB.** s2Member Pro was incorrectly handling scenarios where a Customer was attempting to create an ARB Profile with a credit card that expires before the 2nd payment in the ARB Profile would clear. s2Member Pro always collects the first payment up front, and starts the ARB Profile to handle future payments. In cases where a Customer's card would expire before the second payment is collected, the creation of the ARB Profile would fail on the Authorize.Net® side, and s2Member Pro was not recovering properly. The result is that the Customer was charged for the first payment, and then left with a decline notice on-site ( not good ). In this release, s2Member Pro has been updated to avoid the situation where a Customer may be declined, with the error `The credit card expires before the subscription startDate`. In this scenario, s2Member will now allow the Customer's transaction to go through ( collecting the first payment in real-time ), and allowing the Customer to gain access. In this case, s2Member knows that future payments will fail because the card will expire beforehand, so an EOT Time for the Customer will be set during checkout.

= v110710 =
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Bug fix.** Some versions of PHP were generating an error `Warning: call_user_func_array()` after registration. This error was caused by a new static class method introduced in s2Member v110708, which was NOT previously declared `static` explicity. This release of s2Member v110710 corrects this bug and eliminates the error message. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.
* **(s2Member) New Feature.** It is now possible to enable/disable s2Member's customization of New User Email notifications. This may be desirable when/if you're using a plugin ( other than s2Member ) to handle this aspect of your installation. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.
* **(s2Member) New Feature.** It is now possible to customize both the Username/Password email ( e.g. the email sent to new Users/Members after registration ), and now you can ALSO customize the Administrative "New User Notification" email too. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.

= v110709 =
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Email Configuration ( bug fix ).** New file `/s2member/includes/functions/pluggables.inc.php` was missing in the last release, weird. This release adds the missing file that implements this new feature included in the previous Changelog. FEATURE: Some new options are now available that allow site owners to customize the email that contains the Username/Password for new Users/Members. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.

= v110708 =
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Compatibility.** s2Member updated to support WordPress® v3.2.
* **(s2Member Pro) Unlimited Membership Levels.** With s2Member Pro installed, you may now configure an unlimited number of Membership Levels. You can set the number of Membership Levels by adding this line to your /wp-config.php file: `define("MEMBERSHIP_LEVELS", 4);`. Feel free to change the default value of 4 to whatever you need. The minimum allowed value is 1. The recommended maximum is 100. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Membership Levels/Labels`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Email Configuration.** Some new options are now available that allow site owners to customize the email that contains the Username/Password for new Users/Members. For further details, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Email Configuration`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro) Bug fix.** A problem with certain email addresses routed through the `wp_mail()` function, containing special characters in the "Name" portion. The issue was related to the way in which `wp_mail()` handles recipient addresses in the format `"Name" <address>`. s2Member now strips double quotes dynamically ( i.e. internally ), so that `wp_mail()` and the PHPMailer class can deal with this format on their own. This bug fix should also prevent seemingly random `500 Internal Server Error` messages during checkout. One symptom of this bug was to find "Premature end of script headers" inside your Apache error log, followed by an error code of `500` reported in the browser. These issues have been corrected in this release of s2Member.
* **(s2Member) Bug fix.** A bug first introduced in v110604 was preventing s2Member from setting a User's "Display Name" during Registration properly. This bug has been corrected in the latest release. In addition, a new configurable option for this behavior has been added to the s2Member General Options panel. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Registration/Profile Fields -> Display Name`.
* **(s2Member) Bug fix.** A bug first introduced in v110604 was preventing s2Member from handling password strenth meters in the Stand-Alone Profile Editing Panel ( i.e. the popup version ).
* **(s2Member) Documentation.** s2Member's `API Scripting` sections inside your Dashboard have been updated in various places, in support of some new API Functions/Constants introduced in the latest versions of s2Member; and also to reference relevant articles in the [s2Member Codex](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=40).

= v110606 =
* **(s2Member). MailChimp® over SSL.** s2Member has been updated to communicate with the MailChimp® API over SSL, for improved security. No action or reconfiguration is necessary, as this only affects the HTTP protocol used during communication with the MailChimp® API.
* **(s2Member). Documentation update.** s2Member has been updated to mention the PHP Execution plugin, which is required to take full advantage of `"Advanced" Download Restrictions`, through the application of a File Download Key. The creation of a File Download `Key`, requires a small PHP code snippet. In order to use PHP scripting inside your Posts/Pages, you'll need to install this handy plugin ( [PHP Execution](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/php-execution-plugin/) ).
* **(s2Member). MailChimp® data center prefix.** Starting with this release, the data center prefix ( ex: `us1`, etc ), will be recorded in s2Member's log file for MailChimp® communication. The only change here, is the inclusion of the prefix in the log file. s2Member has always used proper data center prefixes, they just weren't included in the log file until now.
* **(s2Member). Amazon® S3 bug fix.** s2Member has been updated to support all regions, and not just the `US Standard`. If you were getting errors in the previous release, related to Amazon® S3 storage locations being accessed inproperly, this release of s2Member v110606 should resolve the issue for you. To put it simply, s2Member now connects to your S3 Bucket using `[bucket].s3.amazonaws.com`, instead of `s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket]`, making s2Member more compatible in this regard; and as suggested by [this documentation](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?RESTAuthentication.html). This also improves the User experience, since your Bucket name will appear in the host name of the download, instead of just `s3.amazonaws.com`. For further discussion, please check [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=10054).

= v110605 =
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** If File Download protection was enabled, changes introduced in the previous release, were causing some site Administrators to receive a "File Download Limit Exceeded" error under the right circumstances. This has been corrected in the release of s2Member v110605.

= v110604 ( instead of s2Member Pro v1.6 ) =
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Versioning.** Starting with this release, s2Member and s2Member Pro will be released with dated versions following this format: `yymmdd`. The version for this release is: `110604`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). s2Member Security Badge.** An s2Member® Security Badge ( optional ), can be used to express your site's concern for security; demonstrating to all Users/Members that your site ( and the s2Member software ), takes security seriously. However, in order to qualify your site, you MUST generate a Security Encryption Key and pass other security standards. For more information, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> General Options -> Security Badge`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Custom Fields For BuddyPress.** s2Member can now integrate your Custom Fields into BuddyPress. Please check your Dashboard for all configuration options. You'll find BuddyPress integration available here: `DashBoard -> s2Member -> General Options -> Registration/Profile Fields`.
* **(s2Member Pro). PayPal® Pro API Updates (First Payment / Recurring Profile Behavior).** s2Member's integration with the PayPal® Pro API has been updated to API v71.0. There is also a new option available to PayPal® Pro Merchants. s2Member now provides site owners the abililty to control the way the first payment in a Recurring Profile is billed. (1)Consolidate w/ Recurring Profile or (2)— Real-Time / Direct Pay ( mission critical ) —. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> PayPal Options -> Account Details`. We recommend: `Consolidate w/ Recurring Profile`, because this keeps all charges associated with a particular Customer organized in your PayPal® account. No matter which option you choose, a first Initial Payment ( when applicable ), will always be charged immediately ( improved in this release ). In cases where it is absolutely critical that a Customer NOT gain access until their first payment has been fully captured, choose: `Real-Time / Direct Pay`, which tells s2Member to authorize/capture the first payment in real-time during checkout, instead of consolidating it into the Recurring Profile.
* **(s2Member). bbPress® 2.0+.** s2Member has been integrated with preliminary support for bbPress® 2.0+ ( i.e. the new plugin variation for WordPress® ). Please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Other Integrations` for further details and a list of current limitations.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Field Labels.** Some additional `for=""` attributes in all Pro Form templates. This improves the reliability of s2Member's JavaScript validation routines. Existing s2Member Pro Customers with modified Pro Form templates MUST update their `for=""` attributes in order for s2Member's JavaScript API to properly validate Customer data entry in this new release. If you're running custom Pro Form templates, check this directory for the updated default templates, so you can merge any changes you've made yourself: `/s2member-pro/includes/templates/forms/`.
* **(s2Member). Amazon S3 Support** Amazon® Simple Storage Service ( Amazon® S3 ). Amazon® S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon® S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon® uses to run its own global network of web sites. s2Member has been integrated with Amazon® S3, so that ( if you wish ), instead of using the `/s2member-files/` directory, you can store all of your protected files inside an Amazon® S3 Bucket.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). jQuery.** Tested s2Member against jQuery version 1.4.4+, including jQuery v1.6. Fixed a bug with `.attr()` returning undefined in jQuery v1.6.
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** Using the Replacement Code `%%current_user_login%%` in a Special Redirection URL for your Login Welcome Page would sometimes result in your Home Page being protected inadvertently, depending on configuration.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). IP Address Collection.** s2Member now records the original IP Address of a each User, for tracking purposes. In previous versions of s2Member, in order to integrate some tracking systems, ( such as iDevAffiliate's server-side call option ), it was required to use the `custom=""` Attribute of your Shortcode to grab a Customer's IP Address. That's no longer required, as Replacement Codes are now made available throughout all aspects of s2Member; giving you easy access to the User's IP Address.
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** Buy Now Coupon descriptions for Specific Post/Page Access were returning invalid details, referencing installments. This bug has been resolved.
* **(s2Member Pro). SSL.** Allow `?s2-ssl` without a value ( accept as true ). This has been implemented for advanced site owners running s2Member Pro Forms.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). API Functions.** New API functions for user Level, Role, Custom Capabilities. These will be documented in our official source code documentation system for s2Member ( also new ). Source code documentation will become available in the s2Member forums, shortly after the official public release of this version.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). New Shortcode Attribute.** For PayPal® Buttons/Forms, you can now apply Shortcode `lc="US"`. Optional 2 character Locale Code ( i.e. Country Code ). This controls the interface language used if/when a Customer chooses PayPal® Express Checkout as their payment method, or upon clicking a Standard PayPal® Button. If unspecified, the language is determined by PayPal®, when possible, defaulting to US english when not possible.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). New Shortcode Attribute.** For PayPal® Buttons/Forms, you can now apply Shortcode `rrt=""`. Regular Recurring Times ( i.e. a fixed number of installments ). Only valid w/ Membership Level Access. When unspecified ( the default ), any recurring charges will remain ongoing until cancelled, or until payments start failing. If this is set to 1 or higher the regular recurring charges will only continue for X billing cycles, depending on what you specify. This is only valid when `rr="1"` for recurring "Subscriptions". Please note that a fixed number of installments, also means a fixed period of access. If a Customer's billing is monthly, and you set `rrt="3"`, billing will continue for only 3 monthly installments. After that, billing would stop, and their access to the site would be revoked as well ( based on your EOT Behavior setting under: `s2Member -> PayPal® Options` ).
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). New Shortcode Attribute.** You can now apply `rra="1"`. This has to do with reattempting failed payments. It has slightly different meanings and option values, depending on whether it's used for a PayPal® Button or a PayPal® Pro Form Shortcode. For instance, for PayPal® Pro Form Shortcodes, this also controls MAXFAILEDPAYMENTS. Please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> PayPal® Buttons/Forms -> Shortcode Attributes Explained`.
* **(s2Member w/s2Member Pro installed). New Shortcode Attribute.** You can now apply `success="http://..."` Attribute to Standard PayPal® Buttons. Success Return URL ( optional ). s2Member handles this automatically for you. However, if you would prefer to take control over the landing page after checkout ( i.e. your own custom Thank-You Page ), you can. If supplied, this must be a full URL, starting with http://. Note, s2Member will NOT use this value if an existing account holder is being modified. s2Member handles account updates ( i.e. billing modification ) in a more dynamic way. Your Success Return URL is only applied to (new) Customers. This feature is enabled with s2Member Pro installed.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** When using ampersands in the `success=""` Attribute, it would break Success Return URLs on some WordPress® installations. s2Member now converts these internally to avoid the issue.
* **(s2Member). Redirection Status Codes.** s2Member's default behavior ( for good reason ), is to send a 301 redirection status when it moves unauthorized Visitors to your Membership Options Page. The reasons for this are well founded. This prevents duplicate content warnings from search engine spiders. However, some web browsers ( like Safari ) make an attempt to cache a 301 redirection into memory, thereby preventing some browsers from reaching the proper areas of your site after logging in, had they been redirected to the Membership Options Page prior. s2Member resolves this problem by detecting all major browser engines ( i.e. `msie|trident|gecko|webkit|presto|konqueror|playstation` ) and sending web browsers a `302` redirection, while still sending spiders/crawlers ( such as the Google® bot ), the proper `301` redirection status. For further details, please check [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=6240&p=14120#p14084).
* **(s2Member). Alternative Views.** Alternative View Restrictions ( now compatible with Ajax search plugins ). For further details, please check [this thread](http://www.primothemes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3087&p=9635#p12882).
* **(s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** Corrected first/last name updates during Pro Form checkout/upgrade routines. s2Member Pro should use ( and update to ) the values submitted, even when already logged-in.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** s2Member was not properly filling the `$_GET["s2member_level_req"]` parameter upon certain File Download Restrictions. For instance, s2Member would sometimes return `s2member_level_req=0`, even though you protected a File inside a Custom Capability and/or Member Level sub-directory. This bug has been corrected.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Time Zone.** s2Member now displays Registration Dates in your list of Users with `date_i18n()` for localized time, as opposed to UTC time. UTC time is still the default time zone ( internally ), this is built into the WordPress® core. However, certain dates displayed on-site are easier to understand in localized time, based on your WordPress® General Settings.
* **(s2Member). Password Confirmation.** s2Member now provides a Password confirmation field on the Standard Registration Form, and in other key areas, such as Profile Editing Panels.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Password Strength Meters.** This version adds Password strength meters in various places ( where it's helpful ); including s2Member Pro Forms, and even the default Registration Form for WordPress®.
* **(s2Member). Multisite Registration.** Cleaned up the default Multisite Registration Form ( i.e. `/wp-signup.php` ), with structural CSS to better support s2Member features.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). SI Captchya.** s2Member now contains default CSS styles ( just two lines ), and JavaScript validation for the popular [SI Capchya](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/) plugin; and also for it's own built-in support of Google's reCAPTCHA service for s2Member Pro Forms.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Custom Field Default Values.** It's now possible to set default text values for single-line and multi-line input/textarea fields too. This only affects Custom Fields you configure with s2Member.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Custom Fields By Section.** Custom Fields by section ( i.e. dividers ). It's now possible to configure certain Custom Fields, so that they start a new section. Your sections can be simple dividing lines, or you can give them a title that will appear on your Registration and Profile Editing forms.
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** s2Member was creating window focus/blur issues on Profile updates through its Stand-Alone version of the Profile Editing Panel ( i.e. when it was popped open in a new window ). This was causing odd behavior Firefox® 4.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Remove First/Last Name.** It is now possible to turn off First/Last/Display Name, on Registration and Profile Editing forms. For configuration options, please check your Dashboard, under: `s2Member -> Registration/Profile Fields`.
* **(s2Member Pro). Data Prefill.** s2Member Pro is now capable of prepopulating some Pro Form fields when/if existing Users buy a Specific Post/Page.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** Fixed nested Custom Registration/Profile Field labels for multi option check boxes/radios. Firefox 4+ had issues with this.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Registration Link Expiration.** The default is built-in, it's (2) days. We don't recommend changing this unless you know what you're doing. Some developers requested the ability to change this dynamically. s2Member now makes this Filter available: `ws_plugin__s2member_register_link_exp_time`.
* **(s2Member Pro). Automatic Upgrade Routine.** s2Member Pro now places your site into maintenance mode ( temporarily ) during an s2Member Pro Upgrade routine.
* **(s2Member). New API Notification.** New "Modification" Notification now available under: `s2Member -> API Notifications`. Say that three times fast!
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). MailChimp® / AWeber® improvements.** This release fixes several bugs related to Automatic Unsubscribes, general list removals, and introduces a new feature call Automatic List Transitions. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API List Servers`.
* **(s2Member). Bug fix.** PayPal® Button Codes should have been including a `charset` input variable for `UTF-8` encoding. This bug has been corrected now. If you've had trouble getting special characters to appear properly in the PayPal® interface, this version should correct those issues for you.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Animated Processing... Buttons.** This release adds simple animated "processing..." messages to all form submission buttons.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). MailChimp® Interest Groups.** Ability to use Interest Groups with Mailchimp List IDs. For examples, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> API List Servers -> MailChimp`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). New EOT Behavior Option.** Automatic Extension of EOT Time whenever a Customer is upgrading a paid Subscription? For configuration options, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member -> PayPal® Options -> EOT Behavior`.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Log Entries.** WordPress® :: s2Member :: s2Member Pro versions now all reported in each log entry. In addition, s2Member now provides logging for all communications with MailChimp® and AWeber® too.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). s2Member Now Requires WordPress® v3.1+.** Backward compatibility for the WordPress® 3.0.x series has been removed. Also removed all `include()` references to `/wp-includes/registration.php`. Deprecated in WordPress v3.1. This file no longer needs to be included.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). s2Member Updates.** New built-in news updates from s2Member developers. This appears in your Dashboard automatically, inside the s2Member menu panels.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Bug fix.** Custom Post Types were not appearing in s2Member's Specific Post/Page Button and Form generators, even when configured properly. This bug has been resolved.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). Documentation.** Built-in documentation updated throughout.
* **(s2Member/s2Member Pro). UI Panels.** Some minor UI improvements.
